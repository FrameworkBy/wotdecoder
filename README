============

World Of Tanks replay file parser/clanwar filter written in Python 3.

Usage
-----
Put replay.py in G:\World_of_Tanks\replays directory.
When executed it will create 3 subridectories (clanwars, incomplete, complete) and move replay files accordingly.

It will also rename clanwar replay files.
       20120811_2134_usa-T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
becomes
       cw20120811_2134_SERB__PCP___Win_T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
Where SERB is a tag of a clan starting on first flag. PCP is a tag of a clan starting on the second flag. Win obviously means owner of a replay file won.

       cw20120814_1939_PCP___CSM___Los_T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
Here PCP started on first flag, owner of replay file lost the match.

Undercores are used to align text so its readable on fixed width console (basically a DIR in command prompt).
Format can be easity edited further in replay.py.
