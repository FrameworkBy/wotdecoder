wotrepparser
============

World Of Tanks replay file parser/clanwar filter written in Python 3.

Wotrepparser filters all of your replay files and sorts them into three categories:
clanwars   - full replay files containing clanwar match.
incomplete - replays from matches you quit before they ended.
complete   - complete replays.
Additionally it will rename your clanwar replays so they are more palatable.

Usage
-----
Copy wotrepparser.py to your \World_of_Tanks\replays directory.
Open command prompt in \World_of_Tanks\replays.
Type (patch to your Python3 install dir)\python.exe wotrepparser.py

When executed it will create 3 subdirectories (clanwars, incomplete, complete) and move replay files accordingly.

It will also rename clanwar replay files.
       20120811_2134_usa-T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
becomes
       cw20120811_2134_SERB__PCP___Win_T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
Where SERB is a tag of a clan starting on first flag. PCP is a tag of a clan starting on the second flag. Win obviously means owner of a replay file won.

       cw20120814_1939_PCP___CSM___Los_T110_07_lakeville.wotreplay
Here PCP started on first flag, owner of replay file lost the match.

Underscores are used to align text so its readable on fixed width console (basically a DIR in command prompt).
Format can be easily edited further in wotrepparser.py.
You can also create your own filters, for more details uncomment
